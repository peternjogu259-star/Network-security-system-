# Network Security System - Phishing Website Detection

This project is an **AI-powered cybersecurity solution** designed to identify and block phishing websites in real-time. It reads phishing and legitimate website data from **MongoDB Atlas**, performs **feature engineering**, trains machine learning models, and exposes a user-friendly **Streamlit interface** for live predictions.

The system is built with **modular pipelines** for training and testing, enabling easy updates and evaluations on new data. It also includes pre-trained model persistence (`model.pkl`, `preprocessing.pkl`) for efficient deployment.

# Project Overview

With the increasing number of phishing attacks targeting individuals and organizations, this project provides a **machine learning-based network defense mechanism** that classifies URLs as **phishing** or **legitimate** based on various attributes extracted from the URL and page structure.

**Key Functionalities:**

- **Connects to MongoDB Atlas** for real-time access to phishing datasets  
- **Preprocesses** and engineers features (e.g., URL length, special characters, domain info)  
- **Trains ML models** such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression  
- **Serializes model and preprocessing pipeline** for reuse in the UI  
- **Streamlit Web App** to input URLs and get phishing predictions instantly  
- Evaluation pipeline with metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix
